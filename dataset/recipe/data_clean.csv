HOW TO ROAST & STORE RED PEPPERS (OR ANY PEPPER REALLY!),  peppers any color if making a large batch and storing in the freezer parchment paper air tight containers that are freezer safe for storing in jars vinegar plain balsamic whitered wine or apple cider mineral salt olive oil clean pint sized mason jars, prepping peppers there are two ways to prepare your peppers for roasting the first is to   the whole pepper seeds stem and all this will work with all roasting s the second is to slice the peppers in  lengthwise remove the stem and seeds and  on the baking sheet cut side down use this for the  and or when using a baking sheet these peppers require no flipping only rotating of the baking sheet this is my favorite way of roasting peppers roasting s    to  f line a baking sheet with parchment or a silpat  peppers on baking sheet bake inches from the flame if using an electric  or there is no flame  baking sheet on the middle rack  peppers for  turning at least once during  using sturdy tongs if peppers are sliced in  no need to turn  rotate the baking sheet  they are ready when charred blackened and blistered whole peppers will still be full of air and puffy once removed from the  as the peppers cool they will deflate and become wrinkly looking broiler i used to have an  where the broiler was underneath the  now mine is in the  either way turn broiler to  high or  if yours is by numbers and char peppers turning every so often until browned and blackened if you ve prepped your peppers by slicing in  no need turn the peppers  adjust the baking sheet turning it to get all the peppers charred this may take anywhere from  open grill  whole peppers on their sides over an open flame on the grill turning every now and then until nicely charred all over depending on how big your grill is will determine how many you can do at one  stove top if roasting  or peppers you can  it over the gas burner of your stove i suppose you  do peppers utilizing each burner  pepper on its side and adjust the flame so it licks the peppers keep an eye on it and turn it as needed to blacken and char about this tends to be a more  consuming since you have to be so watchful steaming peeling while peppers are hot from the  carefully  them in a bowl and cover with a plate or use a pot with lid the goal is to steam the peppers making the skin peel easily let the peppers steam for about  once peppers are cool remove the skins stems and seeds i find it easiest to peel the pepper from the bottom to the top a few seeds left are fine do not run peppers under water to clean you ll lose most of the roasted flavor that you worked so hard get keep as  of the pepper juices as you can if storing leftovers from here you can use right away to make hummus romesco soups layer on sandwiches and toss in salads  storing rerfrigerator great for short term storage keep leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a days if you coat them with a little oil they will for a couple of weeks you can even  some of the pepper juices to the container to  be safe at the first sign of mold or spoilage throw away  if storing for longer you have a couple simple options freezing this is my favorite of long term storing as it is not blended with any other flavors it s super easy to do and they thaw out amazingly well freeze your peppers in a tightly sealed container they thaw out pretty fast once removed from the freezer making this a nice way of preserving your precious peppers this of storing is a neutral way of keeping the full roasted flavor intact as they won t be tainted with any other flavors i would suggest cutting and placing a small piece of parchment paper between the peppers for easy removal will last up to months vinegar this is will leave your peppers with a little bit of tang from the vinegar in some cases it may overpower them but it s a great way to store them use these peppers for sauces dips and soups  peppers in a jar with a little salt vinegar and pepper juices to do this you ll want to sprinkle your peppers with a generous pinch of mineral salt and  well  inch of vinegar at the bottom of your pint sized mason jar  peppers leaving about inches headspace using the handle of a spoon or fork poke along the inside edges of the jar to release air bubbles this is important pour reserved pepper juices over top so peppers are completely covered leaving inch room  about inch of olive oil over top to keep air out leaving inch headspace seal and  towards the back of the refrigerator will be good for up to months  even a little longer if you see any sign of mold or spoilage throw away ,46,9,"1,5","0,4",main course,dinner,0,
